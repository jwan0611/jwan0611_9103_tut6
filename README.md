- **Imaging technique of inspiration:** Image fusion (to apply to the painting *The Scream* in the assignment as an animation responding to mouse input) 
- **Aspect of the example:** Inside the original painting *The Scream*, the character itself is featureless, ungendered, and de-individualized. And perhaps one of the reasons despite being a deeply personal painting, it has become a universal symbol of anxiety. So it's about what we the viewers bring into it. The design concept is to place their individual face on the screaming character so that every audience sees their own reflection. As one zooms in the painting, it shows his/her facial features on the screaming face. With the audience's live image, the artwork can be animated as well.

- **Coding technique:** - Convolution Neural Networks, Poisson fusion  
- **How this technique helps:** Convolution Neural Networks can add a filter to the facial Image of every person so it has the style of the painting _The Scream_ by changing the color pixels and face distortion. Poisson fusion can change the shadow into the target style (the style of *The Scream* ) and enable spatial and lighting matching between two totally different images. With these techniques, the real photo of an audience can be blended seamlessly into the painting. 
- **Coding technique in action:**
