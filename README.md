Part 1
1. [image technique of inspiration]  Filter, Image fusion

Part2
[coding technique] - Convolution Neural Networks, Poisson fusion  
[how this technique helps?] Convolution Neural Networks can add a filter to the face Image of every person so it has the style of the painting _The Scream_ by changing the colours and
