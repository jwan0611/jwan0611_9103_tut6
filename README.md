- **image technique of inspiration:**  Filter, Image fusion (to apply to the painting *The Scream* in the assisgment) 
- **Aspect of the example:** Inside the painting *The Scream*, the character itself is featureless, ungendered, and de-individualized. And perhaps one of the reasons despite being a deeply personal painting, it has become a universal symbol of anxiety. It is a blank page in which one can protect himself, so it becomes about what we the viewers bring into it. The design concept is to combine their individual face with the screaming character so that every audience sees their own reflection. When one zooms in the painting, it shows his/her facial features at the screaming face.

**Image fusion:**


 
# Part 2

- **Coding technique:** - Convolution Neural Networks, Poisson fusion  
- **How this technique helps:** Convolution Neural Networks can add a filter to the facial Image of every person so it has the style of the painting _The Scream_ by changing the colors and face distortion. 
- **Coding technique in action:**
